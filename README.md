# News2Go: Balanced News Aggregator Platform

**Team ReLU** set out with a clear mission: **combat online misinformation and political bias**.  

Our solution is **News2Go**, a news aggregator platform that delivers **diverse perspectives on current events**. Instead of relying on a single outlet, users can explore coverage from multiple sources, each with different political leanings. This empowers people to **access balanced information** and form their **own independent opinions**.  

---

## Features
- **Search & Filter**: Find articles on specific topics quickly.  
- **Diverse Sources**: Articles pulled from multiple outlets with varying political biases.  
- **Bias Alerts**: Clearly flags when different outlets report the same facts but with different perspectives.  
- **React Frontend**: Built with modern React components (`Navbar`, `ArticleCard`, `ArticleList`) for a clean UI.  
- **Expandable Backend**: Designed to fetch and serve article data via a REST API (`/api/articles`).  

---

## Tech Stack
- **React.js** – frontend framework  
- **HTML5 / CSS3** – structure & styling  
- **Node.js (planned)** – backend API to serve aggregated articles  
- **JavaScript** – app logic & interactivity

This project was the **final pitched idea** for a **local democracy hackathon in October 2024**.

P.S This is part 1 of the code (React-based implementation), part 2 (static prototype) is in another repo (working on changing this).
